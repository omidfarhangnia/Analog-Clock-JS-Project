- link to this project : [Click Here](https://omidfarhangnia.github.io/Analog-Clock-JS-Project/);

This project was created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. At first i added the basic div for structure of the main  clock, then i used CSS for style and animation. I used Javascript for creating logic of this project and rotating the  
arrows and some other script.
